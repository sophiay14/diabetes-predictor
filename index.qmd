## Can clinical data really help predict diabetes?

Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition affecting millions and early detection is key. In this project, we explore a real medical dataset from Pima Indigenous women to build a logistic regression model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes using only 8 routine health measurements, including glucose levels, BMI, age, and insulin.

By analyzing these variables, we uncover which health factors matter most and visualize how the model interprets patient data. The goal is to turn numbers into meaningful risk insights, using simple statistical tools to support smarter, earlier intervention.
